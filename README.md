# üèÉ School Race Manager

A full-stack web application built with **Ruby on Rails** and **React** that empowers teachers to set up and manage race results effortlessly. Featuring a React frontend integrated within a Rails application, this project offers a streamlined experience for organizing races, assigning students to lanes, recording finishing positions (including ties), and viewing detailed results.

## üöÄ User Stories

- **Race Setup:**
   - As a teacher, I want to create, update, and delete any students in the school so that I can manage the list of participants.
   - As a teacher, I want to create a race with at least 2 students, ensuring that each student is assigned to a unique lane.
   - As a teacher, I want to prevent the same student from being assigned to more than one lane in the same race.

- **Recording Results:**
   - As a teacher, I want to record the final finishing positions for each student once a race is completed.
   - I want the final places to be entered without gaps (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 is valid; 1, 2, 4 is not).
   - In the event of a tie, the next available position should skip the number of tied athletes (e.g. (1, 1, 3) is valid; (1, 1, 1, 2) is invalid).

- **Viewing Results:**
   - As a teacher, I want to view the detailed results of each race so that I can quickly determine the winners and hand out medals.
   - As a teacher, I want to view the list of students
